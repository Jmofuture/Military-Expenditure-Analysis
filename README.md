### Analysis of military expenditures of more than 150 countries between 1960 and 2019 expressed in U.S. dollars.

Data transformation using Power Query Editor functions to create dashboard-type reports.


### Power Query transformations

- We load the dataset data into PowerBi.
- The table contains blank columns and rows so we have to clean the data and delete what is not useful for Power Query.

- The first 3 columns and the first two rows are deleted.
- The first row is assigned as header to obtain the column headings.
- We must fill in the continent data since we only have it in the first row corresponding to its countries.
